Description:
I have followed the videos instructions on how to proceed with Test 2. I have downloaded the necessary files. I have setup GitHub Repository, and I have created and assigned the issues. I got a little to carried away and added my orgianl issues to 'Done' early and so created a new round of issues that is why their numbers are higher than they need to be. I have proceeded with adding the necessary code to the CustomerOrderTest file and created the necessary branches for each section. I have merged the braches as well. I believe that is everything that was covered in the Intsruction Video.
